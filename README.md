Homework for AY250 in Spring 2018

Homework 3 Notes:
[] The code is (I think) pretty well commented so it should be clear what is happening.
[] The credentials for API access are stored in the creds.py file that should be in the same folder as the hw3_eades.ipynb file. This is commented at the top of my code where the imports are.
[] To get a WolframAlpha credential, go to https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/apisignup.html and sign up.
