# Homework 6

Caleb Eades

Due: April 2, 2018

The code should be fairly straightforward to follow as there are plenty of docstrings markdown cells explaining little bits that might be confusing.

The features I wound up using are:

Censure features: mean and std

Structure tensor features: mean and std of each of Axx, Axy and Ayy

Mean color features: the mean of each color channel

Aspect ratio: the ratio of the height to width

Color correlations: correlations between each possible pair between the three channels.
